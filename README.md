I love analytics for the variety of tasks: the work of a data analyst is not limited to collecting and processing information. An analyst should be able to identify patterns, make forecasts, and create decision support systems. This makes the work interesting and diverse.

ðŸ‘€ Information is the new oil. Information with numbers and their interpretation is a nutritious cocktail for business. And I can cook it!
I like to study remotely, I have completed a lot of Stepik courses. I solve math, statistics, SQL, and Python problems every day. I regularly participate in specialized webinars.I'm learning English.

I can already do this:

* I can collect, process and analyze data in Python using the pandas and NumPy libraries.
* I can visualize data using matplotlib, seaborn and plotly libraries.
* I have basic machine learning skills using the SciPy and sklearn libraries.
* I can build interactive dashboards using Tableau.
* I know SQL, I can write advanced queries using window functions.
* I know the basics of statistics and understand how statistical tests work.
* I can determine the parameters of A/B tests, conduct them and analyze the results.
* I am proficient in cohort analysis, I can calculate the basic KPIs of a business and analyze the effectiveness of advertising.
* I know how to build and analyze product and marketing funnels.
* I am able to carry out a full cycle of solving an analytical problem â€” from formulation to preparation of business conclusions.
* I can create analytical presentations for customers.

âš¡ Fun fact: I don't have bad habits - I don't drink or smoke at all. I like to do powerlifting.
